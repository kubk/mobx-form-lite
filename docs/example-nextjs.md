# Next.js

The `mobx-form-lite` is a collection of MobX stores and functions to operate on them. Thus, using `mobx-form-lite` with Next.js is no different from using MobX with Next.js.

Check out this [example on GitHub](https://github.com/kubk/mobx-form-lite/tree/main/playground-next) demonstrating the usage of `mobx-form-lite` with Next.js. The form logic is located [here](https://github.com/kubk/mobx-form-lite/blob/main/playground-next/src/pages/index.tsx).
